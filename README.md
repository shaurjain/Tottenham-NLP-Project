# Tottenham-NLP-Project

The aim of the project was to find Tottenham Fans' sentiment regarding the appointment of Nuno Espirito Santos as the new head coach


• Gathered 1500 Tweets using the twitter API. The replies of the following Tweet were retrieved: https://twitter.com/SpursOfficial/status/1410317279598944263

• Used various NLP techniques to clean the tweets

• Labelled the dataset and make used TFIDF/ Count Vectorizer on the cleaned Tweets

• Considered Logistic Regression and SVM finding best hyperparameters using GridSearch CV

• The final Tweet classifier model (to determine whether a fan is happy about the appointment or not) had an accuracy of 82% and an F1 score of 80%

• Demonstrated the use of the model on a Tottenham Fanpage: 'ExpressionsOOZ'
